Hypper ledger:

. The policy that specifies the set organizations on the channel that need to execute the smart contract is referred to as the endorsement policy.
. Before a chaincode can be deployed to a channel, the members of the channel need to agree on a chaincode definition that establishes chaincode governance.

The ledger is the sequenced, tamper-resistant record of all state transitions in the fabric. State transitions are a result of chaincode invocations (‘transactions’) 
submitted by participating parties. Each transaction results in a set of asset key-value pairs that are committed to the ledger as creates, updates, or deletes.

The ledger is comprised of a blockchain (‘chain’) to store the immutable, sequenced record in blocks, as well as a state database to maintain current fabric state.
There is one ledger per channel. Each peer maintains a copy of the ledger for each channel of which they are a member
